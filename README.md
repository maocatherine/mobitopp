# mobiTopp
[mobiTopp](http://mobitopp.ifv.kit.edu/) is an agent-based travel demand model developed at the [Institute for transport studies at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://www.ifv.kit.edu/english/index.php). Publications about mobiTopp can be found on the [project site](http://mobitopp.ifv.kit.edu/28.php).

## Execution
**Please click the mobitopp-matsim-coupling folder and read the instruction there. You need to load this parent repository and also another seperate repository to run the coupling. I am still learning the submodule control so need a bit of time to make them perfect. Follow the instruction there.**

### Using gradle
The example project comes shipped with gradle tasks to run it directly from source. A population can be generated with the `runPopulationSynthesis` task and travel demand can be simulated using the `runSimulation` task. 

```
./gradlew runPopulationSynthesis runSimulationMatsim or runMobitoppOnly
```
If you are using Intellij you can execute directly from the verticle Gradle shortcut button.

### Using eclipse
The example project contains preconfigured launch configurations to create a population and simulate the travel demand. Eclipse automatically detects them and you can run them from the toolbar as every other launch configuration.

## Results
mobiTopp generates various output files during population synthesis and simulation. Most of the output data is self-explanatory. For those values which are not, the following tables map the codes to their values.
